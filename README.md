# 42-fract-ol

Fract-ol is one of the first graphical projects at 42 school and introduces us to 2D programming with fractal generation. Fract-ol generates beautiful fractals from complex numbers of an iterative mathematical construct. A fractal is a fragmented geometrical figure that infinitely repeats itself at smaller scales. This project uses the school's graphical library, MiniLibX.

To install and compile Fract-ol, clone the repository and include the MiniLibX repository: `git clone https://github.com/myagjz/fract-ol.git && cd fract-ol && git submodule init && git submodule update`. Then you will be in the correct directory and can compile with `make`.

To run Fract-ol, you must specify a fractal to display. You can also provide other optional parameters: `./fractol < type > < options >`. Types are: M, m or 1: Mandelbrot fractal; J, j or 2: Julia fractal; B, b or 3: Burning Ship fractal; T, t or 4: Tricorn fractal; X, x or 5: Mandelbox fractal.

While Fractol is running, the following controls are available: W A S D or ▲ ◄ ▼ ► to move; - , + or scroll wheel to zoom in and out; space to change color scheme; left click to shift Julia set [Julia only]; 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 or 5 to switch fractals; esc or close window to quit Fract-ol.
